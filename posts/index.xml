Now it&amp;rsquo;s time to share it with the Internet. We will levarage Github pages as our hosting environment. Why? Because it&amp;rsquo;s free!
I&amp;rsquo;m gonna assume that you already have a Github account, and also install git in your local machine. You should create a new repository in your Github, give it the name personal-blog for the sake of simplicity.</description></item><item><title>Hello World</title><link>https://sunkeneyes.dev/posts/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jul 2022 15:14:05 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://sunkeneyes.dev/posts/hello-world/</guid><description>As I'm getting older it's harder for me to remember things while I realize there are more things I need to learn. Improving my memory is important. Jotting things down so that I can revise later is also a good alternative. Go is a powerful programming language, and has been my "main" programming language for a few years by the time this post is being written. I'm excited to learn Hugo, and hopefully I can create something fun with it.</description></item></channel></rss>
