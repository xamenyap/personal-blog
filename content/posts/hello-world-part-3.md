In the previous post, we have successfully pushed our source code to Github, and levaraged Github Pages to host our blog. We also explored Github action to set up an automatic build pipeline for our blog. In this tutorial we will learn how to deploy our blog using our own domain while still leveraging all of the tools Github provides.

## Domain purchase
There are many services where you could buy a domain from. Personally I don't have much experience with this, namecheap was recommended by my friend some times ago. I bought some domains from namecheap already, and the price for a 1 year subscription is around $10. Depending on what domain you desire the price could be lower, or higher. Some domains may even cost you $100 per year. So let's grab a domain of your choice, and we will continue this tutorial.

From this point onward, we will assume that you bought a domain from namecheap, and in the next section we'll explore how to configure the newly bought domain so that it works well with your Github pages.
