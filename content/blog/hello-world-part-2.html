<p>
	We successfully created a blog in our local environment in the first part of this tutorial. Now it's time to share it with the Internet. We will levarage Github pages as our hosting environment. Why? Because it's free!
</p>
<p>
	I'm gonna assume that you already have a Github account. But if you haven't done it yet, go ahead and register for a free one. Then you should create a new repository, give it the name <b>personal-blog</b> for the sake of simplicity. Make your repository public because Github pages deployment requires so (you can make it private if you're willing to pay though).
